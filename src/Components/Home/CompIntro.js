        <h2>About Us!</h2>
        <p>Hello! my name is Jo Avellina the owner of Space Magic Retro Gaming 
          We are a small independent company that buys, sells, and repairs 
          old retro gaming consoles. I made this company with the idea of keeping
          retro gaming alive long into the day of our grand children. I have a huge
          passion for gaming and working on small electronics like these consoles.
          I hope our company can restore that old childhood nostalgia returning you
          back into the good ol days of being a kid with out a worry in the world.
          Click on the second tab to see the awesome consoles we buy, sell, and trade.
